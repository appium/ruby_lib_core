    # for instance, to simulate multiple finger swipes.

    # Create a series of touch actions by themselves (without a `prepare()`), then
    # add to a new MultiTouch action.  When ready, call `prepare()` and all
    # actions will be executed simultaneously.

    # @example
    #
    #   @driver = Appium::Core.for(self, opts).start_driver
    #   action_1 = TouchAction.new(@driver).press(x: 45, y: 100).wait(5).release
    #   action_2 = TouchAction.new(@driver).tap(element: el, x: 50, y:5, count: 3)
    #
    #   multi_touch_action = MultiTouch.new(@driver)
    #   multi_touch_action.add action_1
    #   multi_touch_action.add action_2
    #   multi_touch_action.perform
