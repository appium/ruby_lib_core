        # @param [String] remote_path The path to the remote location, where the resulting video should be uploaded.
        #                             The following protocols are supported: http/https, ftp.
        #                             Null or empty string value (the default setting) means the content of resulting
        #                             file should be encoded as Base64 and passed as the endpount response value.
        #                             An exception will be thrown if the generated media file is too big to
        #                             fit into the available process memory.
        #                             This option only has an effect if there is screen recording process in progreess
        #                             and +forceRestart+ parameter is not set to +true+.
        # @param [String] user The name of the user for the remote authentication.
        # @param [String] pass The password for the remote authentication.
        # @param [String] method The http multipart upload method name. The 'PUT' one is used by default.
        # @param [String] file_field_name The name of the form field containing the binary payload in multipart/form-data
        #                             requests since Appium 1.18.0. Defaults to 'file'.
        # @param [Array<Hash, Array<String>>] form_fields The form fields mapping in multipart/form-data requests since Appium 1.18.0.
        #                             If any entry has the same key in this mapping, then it is going to be ignored.
        # @param [Hash] headers The additional headers in multipart/form-data requests since Appium 1.18.0.
        # @param [Boolean] force_restart Whether to try to catch and upload/return the currently running screen recording
        #                                (+false+, the default setting on server) or ignore the result of it
        #                                and start a new recording immediately (+true+).
        # @param [integer] fps The count of frames per second in the resulting video.
        #                      Increasing fps value also increases the size of the resulting video file and the CPU usage.
        #                      The default value is 15.
        # @param [String] preset A preset is a collection of options that will provide a certain encoding speed to compression ratio.
        #                        A slower preset will provide better compression (compression is quality per filesize).
        #                        This means that, for example, if you target a certain file size or constant bit rate, you will
        #                        achieve better quality with a slower preset. Read https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264
        #                        for more details.
        # @param [Boolean] enable_cursor_capture Whether to capture the click gestures while recording the screen. Disabled by default.
        # @param [Boolean] enable_capture_clicks Recording time. 180 seconds is by default.
        # @param [String] video_filter The video filter spec to apply for ffmpeg.
        #                              See https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/FilteringGuide for more details on the possible values.
        #                              Example: Set it to +scale=ifnot(gte(iw\,1024)\,iw\,1024):-2+ in order to limit the video width
        #                              to 1024px. The height will be adjusted automatically to match the actual screen aspect ratio.
        # @param [integer] device_id Screen device index to use for the recording.
        #                            The list of available devices could be retrieved using
        #                            +ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i ""+ command.
        #                            This option is mandatory and must be always provided.
        # @param [String] time_limit The maximum recording time. The default value is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
        #                            The minimum time resolution unit is one second.
        #
        # @example
        #
        #    @driver.start_recording_screen
        #    @driver.start_recording_screen fps: 30, enable_cursor_capture: true
